# IMAGE TEXT CRYPT
This is a project to demonstrate how to hide text inside image color bits.

The application manipulates only the red color and do not encrypt the text before  put it on the image, what means that more improvements can be made for this project. The intention is just to be a sample.

*To run this project is needed to create a folder on the directory **C:\\ImageCrypto** and put a image with name **BaseImage.jpg**.*
